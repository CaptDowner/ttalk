#About TommyTalker

##Recent news! 

I've just completed i18n translation support for 27 languages using Google's translation engine. This means that TommyTalker is now a tool for non-English speakers. They can read a sentence or phrase in their native language and when the select it, the words are spoken in English.

I need contributors who can review my translations in their native language, and make corrections so the phrases make sense to them and other who speak/read their native language. Ideally, you have an understanding of English, at the phrases level of the program, and can make vocabulary/grammar changes to one of the files in the  [railsroot]/config/locales directory.

Files like 'es.yml' need to be reviewed by a Spanish speaker, 'de.yml' by a German speaker, 'fr.yml' by a French speaker, and so on. I have already Google translated 981 phrases/words from English to 27 languages. By having accurate 
translations, it can be a really useful tool for non-English speakers to communicate with English speakers by touching or clicking a link.

Here is the list of languages and associated files that require review and correction:

All of these YAML files are located in talker/config/locales/.

 Language     | file     | Language       | file  
 -------------| -------- | -------------- | ------
 __Arabic__   |  ar.yml  | __Lithuanian__ | lt.yml
 __Bosnian__  |  ba.yml  | __Norwegian__  | no.yml
 __Chinese__  |  zh.yml  | __Polish__     | pl.yml
 __Croatian__ |  hr.yml  | __Portuguese__ | pt.yml
 __Czech__    |  cs.yml  | __Romanian__   | ro.yml
 __Dutch__    |  nl.yml  | __Russian__    | ru.yml
 __French__   |  fr.yml  | __Spanish__    | es.yml
 __German__   |  de.yml  | __Swedish__    | sv.yml
 __Greek__    |  el.yml  | __Thai__       | th.yml
 __Hungarian__|  hu.yml  | __Turkish__    | tr.yml
 __Italian__  |  it.yml  | __Ukrainian__  | uk.yml
 __Japanese__ |  ja.yml  | __Vietnamese__ | vi.yml
 __Korean__   |  ko.yml  |

If you have some spare time to do this or even if you know someone who has the non-English language skills to tackle this, please email me at: captdowner@gmail.com

I don't have a budget for this, and as this is an open source web app, I'm hoping I can collaborate with others to make the web app more useful. Each contributor of a language translation that is reviewed and corrected will be given prominent credit when that language is selected by the user and will be listed in the general credits, which will be linked to or part of the About page.

This project's original goal is to help people who have difficulty speaking. This might be due to a surgery, a disease, or folks who have been born without the ability to speak. A close family member of mine was recently diagnosed with a 
rare condition called cerebellar ataxia, which causes the cerebellum to shrink over time. One of the worst things is that over time you lose your ability to speak clearly, yet you retain all of your other mental faculties. So this web app gives him and others in similar conditions to make themselves understood easily.

This does not attempt to handle text to speech translation, as there are many apps that do a great job of that. TommyTalker is really designed for folks who need an easy to use tool that doesn't necessarily require a lot of typing, to help them to communicate with others, in a simple, straightforward manner.

It is designed as a web app and can be run on any device that has a browser and a speaker which includes most  smartphones.

There are multiple pages, each one organized alphabetically, that the user can access when they need to communicate SOMETHING to someone. 

The application is currently under active development and evolving daily. Some of the features we hope to add soon 
include the following:

- more common phrases
- categories
- user ordering
- additional voices
- other languages
- text-to speech to be combined
  with point and click phrases
