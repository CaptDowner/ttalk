#About TommyTalker
Recent news! 

I've just completed i18n translation support for 27 languages. This means 
that TommyTalker is now a tool for non-English speakers. They can read a 
sentence or phrase in their native language and when the select it, the 
words are spoken in English.

This project's original goal is to help people who have difficulty speaking.
This might be due to a surgery, a disease, or folks who have been 
born without the ability to speak.

This does not attempt to handle text to speech translation,
as there are many apps that do a great job of that. TommyTalker 
is really designed for folks who need an easy to use tool that 
doesn't necessarily require a lot of typing, to help them to
communicate with others, in a simple, straightforward manner.

It is designed as a web app and can be run on any device that has a 
browser and speakers including most smartphones.

There are multiple pages, each one organized alphabetically, 
that the user can access when they need to communicate SOMETHING 
to someone. 

The application is currently under active development and 
evolving daily. Some of the features we hope to add soon 
include the following:

- more common phrases
- categories
- user ordering
- additional voices
- other languages
- text-to speech to be combined
  with point and click phrases

If you are comeone, or you know someone who might be 
interested in contributing, please contact me by email

We need a good designer, other language speakers to implemnt 
phrases and recording of phrases in their native language.
Ruby and Rails contributors are always welcome, so 
please fork away.
