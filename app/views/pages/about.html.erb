  <!-- We've added support for 26 languages. The text can be presented in all of them, and when links are selected, they are spoken in English.
        This can be a big help for non-English speakers, and by selecting an appropriate phrase, they can be understood in English.
        This expands the use of the program to both speech impaired folks along with non-English folks who'd like to communicate in English.
