1. Dropped mode column from Users.
2. Dropped voice column from Users.
3. I would like to have MP3_PATH default to the 
   male voice samples, and be optionally changed  
   by the user, rather than storing identical paths
   for every mp3 file. Then I could access the mp3file 
   preceded by the path which would represent 
   different voices(e.g. male, female, child, cartoon)

   voices = %w[male,female.child,cartoon]

   eg. - /rails/app/assets/sounds/male
         /rails/app/assets/sounds/female
         /rails/app/assets/sounds/child
         /rails/app/assets/sounds/cartoon

# abstract this to a program var determined at sign-in
# can be changed during the course of the program by the user
audio_dir = /app/assets/sounds/ # same for all audio files

# user selectable, with default stored in user's Option object.
# and would be appended to the audio_dir at runtime
paths = %w[male/, female/, child/, cartoon/] 

# then, only the audio_fname needs to be stored in the database,
# as each voice would use the same filename for mp3 audio files.

class Option
  #voice:string       # user's preferred default voice: male,female,child,cartoon
  #language:string    # user's preferred full language name, eg. English, Spanish, Russian, ...
  #lang_abbrev:string # user's preferred language abbreviation, eg. "en", "sp", "ru",
  # 
end



Current questions

1. For i18n translations, will the default locale be stored in the user model?
   If so, pages can be loaded with a before statment to take the local into
   account. 

   http://blog.lingohub.com/2013/08/internationalization-for-ruby-i18n-gem/



Passing the locale as a domain name or a subdomain


The information on the current locale can be passed through:

    URL query parameter  ( http://example.com/?locale=sr )
    URL path  ( http://example.com/sr/ )
    domain name  ( http://example.sr )
    subdomain name  ( http://sr.example.com )
    client supplied information

Setting the locale from the domain name or subdomain makes the locale of the current page very obvious and search engines also like this approach.

It is easy to implement it in Rails by adding a before_action to ApplicationController:

before_action :set_locale

def set_locale
  #extracting from the domain name
  I18n.locale = extract_locale_from_tld || I18n.default_locale

  #extracting from subdomain:
  #I18n.locale = extract_locale_from_subdomain || I18n.default_locale
end

def extract_locale_from_tld
  parsed_locale = request.host.split('.').last
  I18n.available_locales.include?(parsed_locale.to_sym) ? parsed_locale  : nil
end

def extract_locale_from_subdomain
  parsed_locale = request.subdomains.first
  I18n.available_locales.include?(parsed_locale.to_sym) ? parsed_locale : nil
end
-----------------------------------------------------------
Rails adds all .rb and .yml files from the config/locales directory to translations load path, automatically. The I18n library will use English as a default locale (if different locale is not set, :en will be used for looking up translations).

By default, Rails expects that all the resource files are kept in config/locales. On the other hand, we prefer to keep them organized in the subdirectories that correspond to the locale names. You might find some other mode of organization better suited, for example separating the models localization from the views localization.

Let’s change some settings by overriding the defaults in application.rb:

    let’s organize the resource files in the subdirectories corresponding to locales instead of storing everything in config/locales,
    set :de as the default locale and
    :en, :de and :fr as available locales

config.i18n.load_path += Dir[Rails.root.join('config/locales/**/*.{rb,yml}').to_s]
config.i18n.default_locale = :de
config.i18n.available_locales = [:en, :de, :fr]

Rails is localized to numerous locales (meaning, all the static text originating from Rails). For a complete list of available locales and information on missing translations or pluralization, you can check this page.

For multilingual applications it is necessary to allow the user to change the current locale and to keep track of this choice. The chosen locale can be stored in a session or a cookie, but this practice is not recommended. The reason is, that locales should be RESTful – transparent and a part of the URL. For example, when a user saves or shares a link to a page that he viewed in a non default locale, visiting that link should show the page in that same locale and not fall back to the default.

The information on the current locale can be passed through:

    URL query parameter  ( http://example.com/?locale=sr )
    URL path  ( http://example.com/sr/ )
    domain name  ( http://example.sr )
    subdomain name  ( http://sr.example.com )
    client supplied information
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Passing the locale as a query parameter within the URL

If the locale information is passed in the URL as a query parameter, setting the locale can be done in before_action (before_filter prior to Rails 4) in the ApplicationController:

before_action :set_locale

def set_locale
  I18n.locale = params[:locale] || I18n.default_locale
end

This requires passing the locale as a URL query parameter and adding it to all the links within the application.

Doing this manually ( for example: link_to( books_url :locale => I18n.locale ) ) is not very convenient. Fortunately, Rails comes with a helper method that can be overridden: ApplicationController#default_url_options:

# app/controllers/application_controller.rb
def default_url_options(options={})
  { :locale => I18n.locale }
end

As a result, every helper method dependent to url_for (e.g. helpers for named routes like root_path or root_url, resource routes like books_path or books_url, etc.) will now automatically include the locale in the query string, like this: http://localhost:3000/?locale=sr.
--------------------------------------------
A trivial implementation of using an Accept-Language header would be:

def set_locale
  I18n.locale = extract_locale_from_accept_language_header
  end

  private
  def extract_locale_from_accept_language_header
    request.env['HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE'].scan(/^[a-z]{2}/).first
  end

1. Better (or best) way to setup mp3 files into Phrase
   object. (Currently plans to use @path and @file)
   * ../assets/media/phrases/en/0001/phrase_1.mp3
   * ../assets/media/phrases/de/0001/phrase_1.mp3

I don't have any current plans to support mp3 files 
for additional languages other than English.
The translations are text-only translations in order 
that other language users who may not have complete 
or any knowledge of English can read the phrase in their 
native language, and select the linkt to have that phrase 
spoken in English.

2. DONE (not needed) What goes into the routes.rb for the mp3file locations
   (perhaps /public/sounds, as a root folder for
   mp3 files)? Final location may be preceded by
   path stored in Phrase object, root path = /public/sounds,
   file location /public/sounds/mine/myfile.mp3).

3. How to best transition from static pages (current)
   to dynamic pages created based on categories?
   * ruby script to read in yml

4. How to setup testing (rspec, minitest, etc...) 
   for initial objects and methods on existing classes.

5. DONE (moved file to public directory)
   Rails is not playing my mp3 files using the same javascript 
   that the prototype version used. Is it simply a path problem 
   or does rails require a specific format or tag, ( e.g. <audio> or 
   something else) in order to pass the file to the clients 
   mp3 playback program?

6. How to best implement the #categories member of the
   Phrase object? Use has_and_belongs_to_many to qualify
   categories as an array of strings? Or as an array or ENUMs 
   that are assigned (locally or globally)? 

   A: via the tag:references member of the Phrase class

7. DONE (via Rails i18n support)Multiple language support? What are the best practices for adding 
   multi language support to a rails app?   Would using the rails 
   'globalize' gem be a good way to do this?

8. I'd like to transition the app (keep it running while) to be database driven,
   so that phrases, categories, translations, etc... would come from the database 
   and the pages will be built dynamically, based on category and sort order.
   The translation strings are each a Hash, so lookups are fast. What advantages 
   would there be by storing the translations in a database (HSTORE in PostgreSQL)?
   Or am I better off storing all the translation in .yml files in the 
   ../rails/config/locales dir?

   A: move string translations from static yml files into Postgres db.

9. Store locale in the database (user information) and load the appropriate language 
   translation at sign-in (or is there a better way)?

   ?? - Is locale a user preference or should we determine it from the users's browser settings?
   ?? - or simply store it as an Option for each user?

The reason for this approach is that I'd like the initial design to include 
a way for later support of multiple languages. Initially, only the link text 
for the phrases would be translated, so that a Spanish user would read the link 
in Spanish, but when clicked on, the English mp3 file would be output.

Languages supported now:

English, Spanish, Mandarin, Japanese, French, German, Polish, Korean, 
Russian, Portuguese, Arabic, Polish

Languages to support later

Italian, Vietnamese, Dutch, Thai, Hindi, Hindustani, Malay-Indonesian

mp3 => file format
  

You should be able to get complete ID3 specification 
at http://id3.org/

Usually Mp3 file have the next format:

[ID3 head(10 bytes) | ID3 tags | MP3 frames ]

ID3 is not part of MP3 format, but it's kind of container which 
is used to put information like artists, albums, etc...

The audio data itself are stored in MP3 frames.Every frame starts 
with 4 bytes header which provides meta info (codecs, bitrate, etc).

Every frame has fixed size. So if there are not enough samples at 
the end of last frame, coder adds silence to make frame have necessary 
size. I also found there chunks like LAME3.97 (name and version of coder).

So, all we need to do is to get rid of ID3 container. The following 
solution works for me perfect, no warnings anymore and out file 
became smaller:

# Length of header that describes ID3 container
ID3_HEADER_SIZE = 10

# Get size of ID3 container.
# Length is stored in 4 bytes, and the 7th bit of every byte is ignored.
#
# Example:
#         Hex: 00       00       07       76
#         Bin: 00000000 00000000 00000111 01110110
#    Real bin:                        111  1110110
#    Real dec: 1014
#
def get_id3_size(header)
  result = 0
  str = header[6..9]

  # Read 4 size bytes from left to right applying bit mask to exclude 7th bit
  # in every byte.
  4.times do |i|
    result += (str[i].ord & 0x7F) * (2 ** (7 * (3-i)))
  end

  result
end

def strip_mp3!(raw_mp3)
  # 10 bytes that describe ID3 container.
  id3_header = raw_mp3[0...ID3_HEADER_SIZE]
  id3_size = get_id3_size(id3_header)

  # Offset from which mp3 frames start
  offset = id3_size + ID3_HEADER_SIZE

  # Get rid of ID3 container
  raw_mp3.slice!(0...offset)
  raw_mp3
end

# Read raw mp3s
hi  = File.binread('hi.mp3')
bye = File.binread('bye.mp3')

# Get rid of ID3 tags
strip_mp3!(hi)
strip_mp3!(bye)

# Concatenate mp3 frames
hi << bye

# Save result to disk
File.binwrite('out.mp3', hi)
