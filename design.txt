1. Debug and refactor ROLES so that current_user and user, vip and admin roles ve
are assigned and recognized, and can be relied on for dynamic page presentations.

2. Get dynamic page presentation working, based on categories.
Design an ActiveRecord query that will get all phrases in a category 
in only one language (the current language == I18n.locale).

http://www.w3resource.com/PostgreSQL/foreign-key-constraint.php

Given a category, get a list from the database containing 
all phrases in alphabetical order, and present them on a page 
in a similar format to the static pages already in use, one page 
per category, although pagination allow for many pages per category.

3. Have the main page buttons, one per category, point to and load when selected,  
the new dynamic pages of each category path.

4. Determine how the design should accomodate sorting phrases on a per user basis.
Should another field (user_id) be added to the category_phrases table, so that a single table will  
handle the lookup of each users categorized phrases? We could index on category_id and user_id so that 
lookups will be fast. I don't plan on giving users the ability to add phrases, so indexing should not become 
a frequently ocurring event.


Or is there  a better way?

Languages should be loaded one at a time, so category_phrases needs to reference a language_id so that 
we will only need 1/26 of the number of references returned when a category is searched for phrases.

 1. Using rails console, how can I execute a query like the following:

# I'm trying to update 27 records at a time, 
# as all 27 language phrases have the same keys
# for each phrase

select id from phrases where key='amipronouncingitcorrectly' order by id;

insert into category_phrases(category_id, phrase_id) 
values(2,
select id from phrases
where key='amipronouncingitcorrectly'
);

I have done this manually using ruby code, but it's not ideal. How can I run a query like this in the rails console using ActiveRecord?

If a lookup is done and it returns all CategoryPhrases for a specific category, then that list needs to be
filtered by language id for selection a subset of the phrase_ids returned.

What would be the (Rails best practices) way to incorporate language id into the query?
 
 2. I need to sort out roles and sessions so that they operate correctly.
  a. Get admin? working for views that will be admin only.
  b. Possible separation of roles between visitor (not signed in)  and user (signed in). Possibly limit Language choices to signed in users?

 3. Change app so that it loads data from the db by language and category. When no category is selected, or a 'Load All' is selected, load all phrases in alpha ASC order. The program currently uses Rails i18m implementation to load phrases and translations from the ../config/locales dir.

 4. Change UI to checkboxes for categories, allowing multiple selections for each phrase and write the result to the category_phrases table, as well as updating the phrase table. Users should inly be able to select categoreies; admins can change phrases, keys and audio_files.

 5. See why sessions are not routing correctly. Change routes.rb as needed.

 6. Create a relationship that can associate user_id with category_phrases, 
such that each user can categorize their own sets of phrases. 
(create another foreign key relationship or add user_id to the 
category_phrases table (category_phrases_users ??)

If I created indexes on both users_id and category_id, lookups should be faster.
  (I could limit when to rebuild indexes to cut down on db processing)
If I limit each user to 100 choice per category (currently 10) 
That would be 1000 possible records per user
1000 records times 1000 users = 1,000,000 total category_phrases_users entries

 7. Populate main page button names from category names and build pages 
dynamically, getting a list of phrases from the db based on language and category 
for each page. Adding a user_id will allow each user to set their own 
category members, and will be looked up with user_id, category_id and phrase_id.

 8. At some point, I'll need to consider performance issues. 
Some of these can be solved by using an in memory database 
(Redis or other) to store frequently loaded data.

Also, some caching strategies might be employed for frequently loaded pages.
What's a good solution and when should I need to worry about it?

 UI stuff:

 9. Do you know how to keep status notification messages and alerts 
    in a fixed position on the page (not displacing page content)?

10. Do you know a way to fade out on certain types of notification 
messages (~ 3 seconds)?

11. Horizontal alignment of top navigation menu (not aligned properly)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

1. US_Idioms contain many phrases that can be used in multiple 
scenarios. The beginning of each phrase might be I|He|She|We|They.
So, either we record each pronoun indificually and combine them 
on the fly for mp3 output or we record them 5 times, each using a 
different context.

  a. If we record each pronoun and combine the mp3 data at run time 
     there would be more computational load on the server

     wheras

  b. If we records multiple versions, there will be more storage 
     required, but no extra compoutational load on the server as 
     it would simply play one of the 5 mp3 files.

     "( I | You | He | She | They | It ) think|thinks that 'Buffalo Soldiers' is a great song."

  c. File selection could be set to each of the pronouns, which 
     would speak a different file depending on which pronoun was selected.

Conclusion: since storage is not an issue at this time, we'll opt for 
the extra files and endure the audio file storage.

A. DONE: Spend some time on rspec functional testing and test
setups.

B. DONE: Decide on how to implement locale.

C. DONE: Setup come categories and how to use the 
   foreign keys to populate/access phrases by 
   tag category(ies).

D. setup a skeleton of a page that loads phrases 
   dynamically, based on category.

E: If not in db, where to put global accessible arrays, hashes for things like
   categories list, languages list, voices list in YAML files?

1. DONE: Got audio working using Rails. I need a better solution, as I ended 
up using a symbolic link from the ../public/ dir to point to the ../assets/sounds dir.

Should I setup a route specifically for the audio files?

2. Completed 26 i18n translation files. I would like to 
decide on how to store the user's locale information.

The information on the current locale can be passed through:

    URL query parameter  ( http://example.com/?locale=sr )
    URL path  ( http://example.com/sr/ )
    domain name  ( http://example.sr )
    subdomain name  ( http://sr.example.com )
    client supplied information

The subdomain name might be the cleanest, as I can use it now to 
indicate which i18n file to present the translated phrases in while still 
using the current set of audio files and speaking English only all locales.

The site would default to English, so both urls:

http://tommytalker.com and
http://en.tommytalker.com 

should present the default pages in English.

The translations would present as:

http://ja.tommytalker.com for Japanese
http://de.tommytalker.com for German
...
http://zh.tommytalker.com for Chinese (simplified)

I still need to store the locale somewhere.
Obvious choices are:

a. Store it as a user param in the user model.
  user.locale='fr'
  or
  options.locale

b. Detect locale from the user's browser.
# A trivial implementation of using an Accept-Language header would be:

  def set_locale
    I18n.locale = extract_locale_from_accept_language_header
  end

  private
  def extract_locale_from_accept_language_header
    request.env['HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE'].scan(/^[a-z]{2}/).first
  end

c. Store locale in a session var. But we still need to save it somewhere between sessions.

d. I think that whichever method we use to detect/set it, we should 
still store it as a user param, or an option param, as some browsers 
may say 'en' when the user would prefer 'es'(Spanish).


Long term goals:

different voices(e.g. male, female, child, cartoon)

   voices = %w[male,female.child,cartoon]

   eg. - /rails/app/assets/sounds/male
         /rails/app/assets/sounds/female
         /rails/app/assets/sounds/child
         /rails/app/assets/sounds/cartoon

# abstract this to a program var determined at sign-in
# can be changed during the course of the program by the user
audio_dir = /app/assets/sounds/ # same for all audio files

# user selectable, with default stored in user's Option object.
# and would be appended to the audio_dir at runtime
paths = %w[male/, female/, child/, cartoon/] 

# then, only the audio_fname needs to be stored in the database,
# as each voice would use the same filename for mp3 audio files, 
# served out of a special path for voice selection.

class Option
  # user_id
  # voice:string      # user's preferred default voice: male,female,child,cartoon
  # lang_abbrv:string # user's preferred language abbreviation, eg. "en", "sp", "ru",
  # browsers          # browser(s) that the user is connected/has connected from
  # devices           # array or string of devices that the user connects/has connected with
  # os                # user's last used operating system (linux, osx, android, windblows, etc...)
  # timezone          # user's time zone offset from UTC time 
  #                     can be used for composing dynamic phrases related to 
  #                     date/time of day.
  ###
end

devices  enum %w[android,pc,mac,notebook,tablet,cellphone,other]
os       enum %w[android,linux,osx,windows]
browsers enum%w[ie,safari,chrome,mozilla,tor,opera,torch,maxthon,sea_monkey,avant,deepnet_ex]



  #language:string    # user's preferred full language name, eg. English, Spanish, Russian, ...
      or              # we can infer one of these next two from the one, 
                      # so one one needs to be stored

Current questions

1. For i18n translations, will the default locale be stored in the user model?
   If so, pages can be loaded with a before statment to take the local into
   account. 

   http://blog.lingohub.com/2013/08/internationalization-for-ruby-i18n-gem/

     before_action :set_locale

     def set_locale
       I18n.locale = params[:locale] || I18n.default_locale
     end

The information on the current locale can be passed through:

    URL query parameter  ( http://example.com/?locale=sr )
    URL path  ( http://example.com/sr/ )
    domain name  ( http://example.sr )
    subdomain name  ( http://sr.example.com )
    client supplied information

Setting the locale from the domain name or subdomain makes the 
locale of the current page very obvious and search engines also 
like this approach.

It is easy to implement it in Rails by adding a before_action 
to ApplicationController:

before_action :set_locale

def set_locale
  #extracting from the domain name
  I18n.locale = extract_locale_from_tld || I18n.default_locale

  #extracting from subdomain:
  #I18n.locale = extract_locale_from_subdomain || I18n.default_locale
end

def extract_locale_from_tld
  parsed_locale = request.host.split('.').last
  I18n.available_locales.include?(parsed_locale.to_sym) ? parsed_locale  : nil
end

def extract_locale_from_subdomain
  parsed_locale = request.subdomains.first
  I18n.available_locales.include?(parsed_locale.to_sym) ? parsed_locale : nil
end
-----------------------------------------------------------
Rails adds all .rb and .yml files from the config/locales directory to translations load path, automatically. The I18n library will use English as a default locale (if different locale is not set, :en will be used for looking up translations).

By default, Rails expects that all the resource files are kept in config/locales. On the other hand, we prefer to keep them organized in the subdirectories that correspond to the locale names. You might find some other mode of organization better suited, for example separating the models localization from the views localization.

Let’s change some settings by overriding the defaults in application.rb:

    let’s organize the resource files in the subdirectories corresponding to locales instead of storing everything in config/locales,
    set :de as the default locale and
    :en, :de and :fr as available locales

config.i18n.load_path += Dir[Rails.root.join('config/locales/**/*.{rb,yml}').to_s]
config.i18n.default_locale = :de
config.i18n.available_locales = [:en, :de, :fr]

Rails is localized to numerous locales (meaning, all the static text 
originating from Rails). For a complete list of available locales 
and information on missing translations or pluralization, you can 
check this page.

For multilingual applications it is necessary to allow the user to 
change the current locale and to keep track of this choice. The 
chosen locale can be stored in a session or a cookie, but this 
practice is not recommended. The reason is, that locales should 
be RESTful – transparent and a part of the URL. For example, when 
a user saves or shares a link to a page that he viewed in a non 
default locale, visiting that link should show the page in that 
same locale and not fall back to the default.

The information on the current locale can be passed through:

    URL query parameter  ( http://example.com/?locale=sr )
    URL path  ( http://example.com/sr/ )
    domain name  ( http://example.sr )
    subdomain name  ( http://sr.example.com )
    client supplied information
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Passing the locale as a query parameter within the URL

If the locale information is passed in the URL as a query parameter, 
setting the locale can be done in before_action (before_filter prior 
to Rails 4) in the ApplicationController:

before_action :set_locale

def set_locale
  I18n.locale = params[:locale] || I18n.default_locale
end

This requires passing the locale as a URL query parameter and adding it 
to all the links within the application.

Doing this manually (example: link_to( books_url :locale => I18n.locale ) ) 
is not very convenient. Fortunately, Rails comes with a helper method that 
can be overridden: ApplicationController#default_url_options:

# app/controllers/application_controller.rb
def default_url_options(options={})
  { :locale => I18n.locale }
end

As a result, every helper method dependent to url_for (e.g. helpers for named 
routes like root_path or root_url, resource routes like books_path or 
books_url, etc.) will now automatically include the locale in the query string, 
like this: http://localhost:3000/?locale=sr.
--------------------------------------------
A trivial implementation of using an Accept-Language header would be:

def set_locale
  I18n.locale = extract_locale_from_accept_language_header
  end

  private
  def extract_locale_from_accept_language_header
    request.env['HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE'].scan(/^[a-z]{2}/).first
  end
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I don't have any current plans to support mp3 files 
for additional languages other than English.
The translations are text-only translations in order 
that other language users who may not have complete 
or any knowledge of English can read the phrase in their 
native language, and select the link to have that phrase 
spoken in English.

3. How to best transition from static pages (current)
   to dynamic pages created based on categories?
   * ruby script to read in yml

4. How to setup testing (rspec, minitest, etc...) 
   for initial objects and methods on existing classes.

6. How to best implement the #categories member of the
   Phrase object? Use has_and_belongs_to_many to qualify
   categories as an array of strings? Or as an array or ENUMs 
   that are assigned (locally or globally)? 

   A: via the tag:references member of the Phrase class
   example implementation needed.

   A: DONE: moved string translations from static yml files into Postgres db.

The reason for this approach is that I'd like the initial design to include 
a way for later support of multiple languages. Initially, only the link text 
for the phrases would be translated, so that a Spanish user would read the link 
in Spanish, but when clicked on, the English mp3 file would be output.

mp3 => file format
  

Complete ID3 specification at http://id3.org/

Usually Mp3 file have the next format:

[ID3 head(10 bytes) | ID3 tags | MP3 frames ]

ID3 is not part of MP3 format, but it's kind of container which 
is used to put information like artists, albums, etc...

The audio data itself are stored in MP3 frames.Every frame starts 
with 4 bytes header which provides meta info (codecs, bitrate, etc).

Every frame has fixed size. So if there are not enough samples at 
the end of last frame, coder adds silence to make frame have necessary 
size. I also found there chunks like LAME3.97 (name and version of coder).

So, all we need to do is to get rid of ID3 container. The following 
solution works for me perfect, no warnings anymore and out file 
became smaller:

# Length of header that describes ID3 container
ID3_HEADER_SIZE = 10

# Get size of ID3 container.
# Length is stored in 4 bytes, and the 7th bit of every byte is ignored.
#
# Example:
#         Hex: 00       00       07       76
#         Bin: 00000000 00000000 00000111 01110110
#    Real bin:                        111  1110110
#    Real dec: 1014
#
def get_id3_size(header)
  result = 0
  str = header[6..9]

  # Read 4 size bytes from left to right applying bit mask to exclude 7th bit
  # in every byte.
  4.times do |i|
    result += (str[i].ord & 0x7F) * (2 ** (7 * (3-i)))
  end

  result
end

def strip_mp3!(raw_mp3)
  # 10 bytes that describe ID3 container.
  id3_header = raw_mp3[0...ID3_HEADER_SIZE]
  id3_size = get_id3_size(id3_header)

  # Offset from which mp3 frames start
  offset = id3_size + ID3_HEADER_SIZE

  # Get rid of ID3 container
  raw_mp3.slice!(0...offset)
  raw_mp3
end

# Read raw mp3s
hi  = File.binread('hi.mp3')
bye = File.binread('bye.mp3')

# Get rid of ID3 tags
strip_mp3!(hi)
strip_mp3!(bye)

# Concatenate mp3 frames
hi << bye

# Save result to disk
File.binwrite('out.mp3', hi)

Program mode => Speak

Links to mp3files containing whole phrases or complete sentences are played on click.

Paste mode => Paste each word or words to an output buffer of text and
concatenate the mp3 files as each word or phrase is added. When the SPEAK 
button is pressed, all of the words in the Paste buffer are spoken.
