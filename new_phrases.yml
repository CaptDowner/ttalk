A ball-park figure
A little birdy told me
Absence makes the heart grow fonder
Act your age
Actions speak louder than words
At this stage
Believe it or not, it's (true|false)
Bite your tongue
Catch (his|her) eye
Come rain or come shine
Come to think of it, you're (right|wrong)
Come what may
Do as (I|He|She|We|They|It) (see|sees) fit
Don't bite the hand that feeds you
Don't blow (his|her|their|our) cover
Don't break (my|his|her|our|their) (heart|hearts)
Don't cramp (my|his|her|our|their) style
Don't get carried away
Don't get caught up
Don't get cold feet
Don't go overboard
Don't hold your breath
Don't lay a finger on (me|him|her|us|them)
Don't let it get you down
Don't let it go to your head
Don't push your luck
Don't rock the boat
Don't take it lying down
Don't turn your back on (me|him|her|us|them)
Don't walk away empty handed
Don't waste your breath
Easy come, easy go
Eat your heart out
Eat your words
Enough is enough
Everything but the kitchen sink
First and foremost
First thing
Free and easy
From all walks of life
Get it off your chest
Give me some elbow room
Hands down
Hang on
He's a peeping Tom
He's a yes-man
Hold on
How on earth did (it|that) happen?
I told you so!
I'd like to give (him|her|them) a piece of my mind
If worst comes to worst
In (my|his|her|our|their) neck of the woods
In the long run
It happened in broad daylight
It'll all work out for the best
It's a hand-me-down
It's a last ditch effort
It's a vicious circle
It's about time
It's coming to an end
It's down the drain
It's falling into place
It's jam-packed
It's open year round
It's raining cats and dogs
It's up for grabs
It's up in the air
Just look the other way
Just sit tight
Keep (it|that) to yourself
Keep your cool
Keep your word
Knock it off!
Knock on wood
Last but not least
Leave (me|him|her|us|them) alone
Let (me|him|her|us|them) know in advance
Let it slide
Let's call it a day
Let's face the music
Let's get a move on
Let's get down to business
Let's get rid of (it|him|her|them)
Let's get something straight
Let's give (you|him|her|them) the benefit of the doubt
Let's go Dutch
Let's hit the road
Let's keep a low profile
Let's kick back
Let's look at it with a fresh pair of eyes
Let's make believe
Let's play it safe
Little by little
Mind your own business
Money talks
Neither here nor there
Never mind
Nip (it|that) in the bud
No rush
No sweat
No wonder
Not in the least
Off the top of (my|his|her|our|their) (head|heads)
On second thought
Once in a while
Please clear the table
Please do the dishes
Please lower your voice
Quite a bit
Ready to jump on the bandwagon
Right off the bat
Ring my bell
She's a bimbo
Silence makes the fart sound louder
Stand up for it
Sucker
Suit yourself
Take it easy
Take it or leave it
Take it slow
Take it with a grain of salt
That was a close call
There are no strings attached
There's more than meets the eye
To make a long story short
Variety is the spice of life
Very well
Way to go!
What makes (me|him|her|us|them|it) tick
What's with (me|him|her|us|them|it)
X marks the spot
You bet!
You can say that again
You can't teach an old dog new tricks
You don't say
Your guess is as good as mine
Zero in on it
